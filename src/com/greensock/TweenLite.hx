/**
 * TweenLite is an extremely fast, lightweight, and flexible animation tool that serves as the foundation of the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). A TweenLite instance handles tweening one or more properties of any object (or array of objects) over time. TweenLite can be used on its own to accomplish most animation chores with minimal file size or it can be used in conjunction with advanced sequencing tools like TimelineLite or TimelineMax to make complex tasks much simpler.

So if the CPU bogs down for 2 full seconds (yikes!), your animations will move 33ms worth of time on the next render instead of jumping a full 2-seconds. Note: this has no affect on the device’s performance or true frame rate – this merely affects how GSAP reacts when the browser drops frames.
	 * @param	adjustedLag The new (adjusted) amount of time (in milliseconds) from the previous tick.
